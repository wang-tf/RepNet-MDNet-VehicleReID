# RepNet-Vehicle-ReID
Vehicle re-identification implementing RepNet

## Vehicle ReID task: </br>
![](./docs/img/VehicleReIDTask.png)

## Basic principle for vehicle ReID task: </br>
Using a two-branch deep convolutional network to project raw vehicle images into an Euclidean space where distance can be directly used to measure the similarity of arbitrary two vehicles. </r>
For simplicity, triplet loss or coupled cluster loss is replaced here by arc loss which is widely used in face recognition.
